# ResQ: Mixed-Precision Quantization of Large Language Models with Low-Rank Residuals
This repository contains the code for the submitted paper ResQ



## Abstract
Post-training quantization (PTQ) of large language models (LLMs) holds the promise in reducing the prohibitive computational cost at inference time. Quantization of all weight, activation and key-value (KV) cache tensors to 4-bit without significantly degrading generalizability is challenging, due to the high quantization error caused by extreme outliers in activations. To tackle this problem, we propose \emph{ResQ}, a PTQ method that pushes further the state-of-the-art. By means of principal component analysis (PCA), it identifies a low-rank subspace (in practice $\nicefrac 1 8$ of the hidden dimension) in which activation variances are highest, and keep the coefficients within this subspace in high precision, e.g.~8-bit, while quantizing the rest to 4-bit. Within each subspace, invariant random rotation is applied to further suppress outliers.  We show that this is a provably optimal mixed precision quantization scheme that minimizes error. With the Llama families of models, we demonstrate that ResQ outperforms recent uniform and mixed precision PTQ methods on a variety of benchmarks, achieving up to 33\% lower perplexity on Wikitext than the next best method \emph{SpinQuant}, and a 2.4$\times$ speedup over 16-bit baseline. Code available here.
